This Maven multi-module project contains the open source Jars to learn.

To build all the example applications run the Maven command:
mvn -e clean package in the project's root folder.  Maven
will the build each module and create a .jar file in the
target sub-folder of each module.

You can then copy the .jar files to your Project.

There is a ReadMe.txt file in each module with instructions 
and the URL to view that application.
